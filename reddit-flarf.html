        This is a <span class="highlight">short story generator using just Redditor comments</span> from August 2015, coded in Processing using the RiTa library. What this resulted in was a jumble of clauses randomly combined to create paragraphs of grammatically-correct but contextually meaningless text.<br/>
            <span class="highlight">Then I had people do their best dramatic readings of it.</span>
              </h5></div>
        
        <div class="invis-border"><h2 id="2">What's Flarf?</h2>
            <p>Flarf began as an experimental poetry movement in the early 21st century that used Google search to generate deliberately bad poetry. This often resulted in semi-coherent, NSFW, comedic, and/or just really weird text. Poems also became revised and plagiarized by other flarf poets. </p><br/><br/>

    <h2 id="3">Why Redditors' comments?</h2>
    <p>
        Just like how flarf came to be, I chose to use Reddit's user comments because of the <span class="highlight">candidness and uncensored nature of online commenting platforms</span> like Reddit's. This wasn't as much of a commentary about internet culture than it was a curious exploration of what would happen if I filtered real user comments through a story generator and invited real people to read it aloud. <br/><br/>I wondered what sort of short stories these Reddit comments would produce and I wondered how people would respond when they were tasked with reading these scripts. I was also really inspired by the short film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY7x2Ihqjmc" id="link">Sunspring</a> and <span class="highlight">how the screenplay was written by algorithms.</span>
        <br/><br/>These scripts don't really have any actual plots or direction to them, but the content itself tended to be overtly political, highly saturated with gaming terminology, and super obscure conversations that I'd never see on my Facebook feed. But either way, what came out of this short-story flarf generator was <span class="highlight">an awkward, mostly incoherent, borderline inappropriate, and all-around awful collection of short storiesâ€” exactly how flarf should be.</span>
